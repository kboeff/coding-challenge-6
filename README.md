# coding-challenge-6
Answer to each question is on separate file: Q1.js, Q2.js and Q3.js
Each solution could be tested by calling a function with some input.
Default test cases are left in the code.

# function names
Q1 -> <strong>organize()</strong><br>

Q2 -> <strong>additions()</strong><br>
Assuming negative numbers and duplicates are valid input.<br>
Same numbers are counted as valid pair <em>(eg. 2+2=4)</em>.<br>
Order of appearance is irrelevant <em>(eg. [1,3] or [3,1], only the first to appear is added to the answer)</em>.

Q3 -> <strong>toggleHex()</strong><br>
Detects the type of input hex/rgb and does the conversion.
Yet to be released as npm package.

The function is published as npm package: <em>npm-togglehex</em><br>
The repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/kboeff/npm-togglehex">github.com/kboeff/npm-togglehex</a>
