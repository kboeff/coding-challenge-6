Answer to each question is on separate file: Q1.js, Q2.js and Q3.js
Each solution is ready for test with one function that requires input.
Default test cases are left in the code - displayed via console.log.

# function names
Q1 -> <strong>organize()</strong><br>
Runs in <em>O(n^2)</em>

Q2 -> <strong>additions()</strong><br>
Runs in <em>O(n^2)</em>, in the worst case.<br>
Assuming negative numbers and duplicates are valid input.<br>
Same numbers are counted as valid adding blocks when it apllies <em>(eg. 2+2=4)</em>.<br>
Order of appearance is irrelevant <em>(eg. if we have [1,3] and [3,1], only the first to appear is added to the answer)</em>.

Q3 -> <strong>toggleHex()</strong><br>
Detects the type of input hex/rgb and does the conversion.
Yet to be released as npm package.
